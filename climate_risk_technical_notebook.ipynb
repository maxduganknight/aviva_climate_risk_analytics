    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a technical analysis of climate risks in Alberta using 44 years of Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) monthly climate data (1981-2025) from 29 weather stations. The analysis identifies statistically significant regime shifts and quantifies changes in extreme weather relevant to insurance risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precipitation Decline**: A structural break in 2008 resulted in a **24.5% reduction** in mean monthly precipitation (p > 0.9999)\n",
    "2. **Extreme Heat Intensification**: Cooling degree days increased became more intense and more frequent following a 2020 regime shift; 100-year heat events are now **8% more intense**\n",
    "3. **Wildfire Risk Escalation**: Fire weather risk that used to only be reached every 100 years now occurs approximately **every 79 years**—a significant jump in frequency of the most dangerous fire weather.\n",
    "4. **High Risk Region**: Many of these interrelated risks are **most pronounced** among weather stations in the Southeast cluster. \n",
